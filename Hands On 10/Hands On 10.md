# Hands On 10 Answers

## 1. Implement a hash table and upload your code to GitHub:
* ### Use the multiplication AND division method for your hash function
    * ### Note your code should be generic enough to allow for ANY hash function
* ### For simplicity assume your keys are integers and the values (data) are integers
* ### Use collision resolution by chaining
    * ### Use a doubly linked list and you must write your own (so for example you can't use "list" in C++)
* ### You are only allowed to use C-style array's for this implementation (so for example no C++ vectors)
* ### Your Hash table should grow and shrink
    * ### When it's full double the array size and re-hash everything
    * ### When it's becoming empty e.g. 1/4 empty, then half the size of the array and re-hash everything
