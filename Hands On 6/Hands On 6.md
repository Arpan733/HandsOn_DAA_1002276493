## 1. Implement both versions of quicksort (random and non-random choice for the pivot) and share the GitHub repository with your source code.
I have uploaded the file "quicksort.py," which contains the quicksort code with random and non-random pivot choices. I have also mentioned the code's output.

## 2. For the non-random pivot version of quicksort show the following benchmarks on the same graph:
### 2a) best case (generate a set of inputs that will always be the best case, repeat for multiple array input sizes "n").
### 2b) worst case (generate a set of inputs that will always be the worst case, repeat for multiple array input sizes "n").
### 2c) average case (generate a set of inputs from a uniform distribution, repeat for multiple array input sizes "n").

## 3. Mathematically derive the average runtime complexity of the non-random pivot version of quicksort.
