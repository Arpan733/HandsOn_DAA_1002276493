# Hands On 10 Answers

## Implement and upload your code to GitHub for:
## 1. "The basic" Binary Search Tree; this is the one that can be unbalanced
## 2. Red Black Tree
## 3. AVL Tree
## Assume the data is integers and make sure to show tests proving your implementation is correct. Implement all operations (e.g. query, adding, deleting, etc..).
