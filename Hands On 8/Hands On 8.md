## 2. Implement and upload your source code to github for: stack, queue, and singly linked list. Make sure to implement the same functionality (api/interface) as the ones from the book.  *Restriction*: Use fixed sized arrays (C style arrays) and assume only integers (C style int) for the data to store.

#### Stack Code File: Stack.py
